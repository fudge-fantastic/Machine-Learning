### Problem Statement: Credit Risk Assessment

In this dataset, we aim to build a predictive model to assess the credit risk associated with customers applying for loans. The target variable "Default_On_Payment" 
indicates whether a customer defaults on their payment (1) or not (0). The dataset comprises various features describing the customer's financial and 
personal information, including credit history, the purpose of credit, duration, savings account status, employment status, income, marital status, and more.

### Objective:
Develop a robust machine learning model to predict the likelihood of default on payment based on the provided features. The model should effectively differentiate 
between customers who are likely to default on payments and those who are not. Our predictive model must assist financial institutions in making 
informed decisions during the credit approval process, ultimately minimizing potential financial risks.
