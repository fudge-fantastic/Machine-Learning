**Project Summary:**
- Task: House rent prediction using regression models.
- Data: A dataset containing various features related to house rentals.
- Objective: Build a model to predict house rents based on the provided features.

**Project Steps:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Obtained the dataset containing information about house rentals.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Explored the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
   - Checked for missing values and handled them if necessary.
   - Visualized the data using plots and graphs to gain insights.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Conducted data cleaning and data scaling as needed.
   - Converted categorical features to numerical using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns and rows.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identified important features that could affect rent prices.
   - Utilized statistical techniques or feature importance from machine learning models.

5. **Model Selection:**
   - Considered various regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
   - Performed cross-validation to evaluate and compare model performance.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Tuned model hyperparameters to optimize performance using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessed models using evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (R^2), and Adjusted R-squared (Adj R^2).

8. **Residual Analysis:**
   - Checked the distribution of residuals to verify if model assumptions were met.
   - Plotted Q-Q plots and histograms for residual analysis.

9. **Feature Importance Analysis:**
   - Analyzed the importance of features in predicting house rents.

10. **Selection of Final Model:**
    - Selected the most suitable model (Random-Forest) based on performance metrics and analysis.

11. **Prediction and Results:**
    - Trained the selected model on the entire dataset.
    - Used the model to make predictions on new data.
    - Evaluated and interpreted model results.

Good job!
